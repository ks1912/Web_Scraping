# Web_Scraping using Python
---------------------------
For doing this you must have bs4 and urllib packages installed in you system
---------------------------
I have taken the example of Flipkart and it's just to display the name
of the product.
# print(containers) -> display the containers element
# print(len(containers)) # return numbers of products in a page
# print(soup.prettify(containers[0])) # return the page in html format basically all the classes and id and html tags will be returned
--------------------------------------
Make sure to un comment them before executing.
